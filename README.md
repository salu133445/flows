# Flow-based Deep Generative Models

Authors: Jiarui Xu and Hao-Wen Dong

We investigate the flow-based deep generative models. We first compare different generative models, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs) and flow-based generative models. We then survey different normalizing flow models, including non-linear independent components estimation (NICE), real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) transformations, generative flow with invertible 1Ã—1 convolutions (Glow), masked autoregressive flow (MAF) and inverse autoregressive flow (IAF). Finally, we conduct experiments on generating MNIST handwritten digits using NICE and RealNVP to examine the effectiveness of flow-based models.
